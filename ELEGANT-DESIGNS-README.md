## Fade Effect Implementation

All three designs implement the requested fade effect with different approaches:

### Design 1 - Complete Fade Transition
```css
.service-tile:hover .tile-image {
    opacity: 1; /* Image fades in */
}

.service-tile:hover .tile-content {
    opacity: 0; /* Content fades out completely */
    transform: translateY(-20px);
}
```

### Design 2 - Dual Layer Fade
```css
.service-tile:hover .tile-image {
    transform: scale(1.1); /* Image scales and shows */
}

.service-tile:hover .tile-service-name {
    opacity: 1; /* Service name appears on image */
}
```

### Design 3 - Split Screen Fade
```css
.service-tile:hover .tile-image-title {
    opacity: 1; /* Service name on image */
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) translateY(-10px);
}

.service-tile:hover .tile-content-half {
    transform: translateX(10px); /* Content slides */
}
```
